# STM32F4 Discovery USB MP3 player

Based on "Benjamin's robotics STM32F4 Discovery USB host and MP3 player" - http://vedder.se/2012/12/stm32f4-discovery-usb-host-and-mp3-player/  
I rebuilt the project on keil, added support for volume control and playback pause. Pause - click on the board, volume - turn the board, switch tracks - button.
